The tutor-remediation hypothesis predicts that students learn best when a tutoring system immediately explains why an entry is incorrect. The self-remediation hypothesis predicts that learning is maximized when learners attempt to correct their own errors. The Cognitive Tutor was used to test these hypotheses because it offers both JITs, which map onto the tutor-remediation hypothesis, and flag feedback, which maps onto the self-remediation hypothesis. To evaluate the effectiveness of JITs, we conducted a naturalistic experiment where learning from older versions of the software, which did not include specific JITs, was contrasted with a later version that included the JITs. The results suggest JITs reduced the frequency of errors; however, this observation was qualified by an aptitude-treatment interaction whereby high- and low-prior knowledge students differentially benefited from JIT availability.}

	abstract     = {Principal stratification is a popular framework for addressing post-randomization complications, often in conjunction with finite mixture models for estimating the causal effects of interest. Unfortunately, standard estimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit pathological behavior. We study this behavior in a simple but fundamental example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which only the component means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in which the components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even $O(n^{-1/8})$. We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our results suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be interpreted with caution in these cases.}

	abstract     = {Abstract From last decade of the 20th century, numerous epidemiological studies and intervention trials have attempted to prove the relationships between maternal periodontal diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). Periodontal diseases are considered a risk factor for APO, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birthweight, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. However, the efficacy of periodontal treatment during pregnancy is controversial. Two pathogenic mechanisms might explain the potential effect of periodontal diseases on pregnancy outcomes. First, periodontal bacteria originating in the gingival biofilm directly affect the feto-placental unit subsequent to bacteremia. Second, inflammatory mediators secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site are carried to the feto-placental unit, where they then cause an inflammatory response. To elucidate these mechanisms, many researchers have been investigating the use of experimental animal models and in vitro models. In the present review, we summarize the current literature on the relationship between periodontal diseases and APO from epidemiological studies, animal models studies and in vitro studies, and speculate on the possible mechanism of periodontal diseases affecting pregnancy outcomes.}

abstract = {Abstract Mediation analysis aims at identifying and evaluating the mechanisms through which treatment affects an outcome. The goal is to disentangle the total treatment effect into two components: the indirect effect that occurs due to one or more intermediate variables, known as mediators, and the direct effect that captures all other possible explanations for why a treatment works. This paper reviews the methodological advancements in the literature on causal mediation in economics, specifically quasi-experimental designs. I define the parameters of interest, the main assumptions and the identification strategies under the counterfactual approach, and present the Instrumental Variables (IV), Difference-in-Differences (DID), and Synthetic Control (SC) methods.},
