abstract = {Abstract From last decade of the 20th century, numerous epidemiological studies and intervention trials have attempted to prove the relationships between maternal periodontal diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). Periodontal diseases are considered a risk factor for APO, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birthweight, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. However, the efficacy of periodontal treatment during pregnancy is controversial. Two pathogenic mechanisms might explain the potential effect of periodontal diseases on pregnancy outcomes. First, periodontal bacteria originating in the gingival biofilm directly affect the feto-placental unit subsequent to bacteremia. Second, inflammatory mediators secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site are carried to the feto-placental unit, where they then cause an inflammatory response. To elucidate these mechanisms, many researchers have been investigating the use of experimental animal models and in vitro models. In the present review, we summarize the current literature on the relationship between periodontal diseases and APO from epidemiological studies, animal models studies and in vitro studies, and speculate on the possible mechanism of periodontal diseases affecting pregnancy outcomes.},

  abstract = 	 { Principal stratification is a popular framework for addressing post-randomization complications, often in conjunction with finite mixture models for estimating the causal effects of interest. Unfortunately, standard estimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit pathological behavior. We study this behavior in a simple but fundamental example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which only the component means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in which the components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even $O(n^{-1/8})$. We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our results suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be interpreted with caution in these cases. }

The tutor-remediation hypothesis predicts that students learn best when a tutoring system immediately explains why an entry is incorrect. The self-remediation hypothesis predicts that learning is maximized when learners attempt to correct their own errors. The Cognitive Tutor was used to test these hypotheses because it offers both JITs, which map onto the tutor-remediation hypothesis, and flag feedback, which maps onto the self-remediation hypothesis. To evaluate the effectiveness of JITs, we conducted a naturalistic experiment where learning from older versions of the software, which did not include specific JITs, was contrasted with a later version that included the JITs. The results suggest JITs reduced the frequency of errors; however, this observation was qualified by an aptitude-treatment interaction whereby high- and low-prior knowledge students differentially benefited from JIT availability.",

More than 3,600 Grade 7 students across nine in-person and one virtual schools within the same district were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Students received nine 30-minute intervention sessions from September 2020 to March 2021. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of the final analytic sample (N = 1,850) showed significantly higher posttest scores for students who used From Here to There and DragonBox 12+ compared to the Active Control condition. No significant difference was found for the Immediate Feedback condition. The findings have implications for understanding how game-based applications can affect algebraic understanding, even within pandemic pressures on learning. }

  abstract = 	 { Principal stratification is a popular framework for addressing post-randomization complications, often in conjunction with finite mixture models for estimating the causal effects of interest. Unfortunately, standard estimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit pathological behavior. We study this behavior in a simple but fundamental example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which only the component means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in which the components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even $O(n^{-1/8})$. We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our results suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be interpreted with caution in these cases. }
